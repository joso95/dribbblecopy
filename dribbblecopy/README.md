## Hello

Thank you for cheking out my project! Here's a short overview of the project.

## JSON

There are 2 JSON files, one for page content and one for card content.
infoForDribbble.json has the content for the navigation, the json is used in ex. header.js who then feeds it forward to navBarComponent.js.
cardContent.json has the information for the cards in the grid. This is used by cardComponent.

## Components

### buttonComponent.js

This is a basic component that can create buttons with an class ID and name if used correctly.

### cardComponent.js

One of the main components for this projects. The CardComponent maps thorugh the items it gets from a JSON and creates the cards in the grid.

### navComponent and NavBarComponent

navComponent creates a list of items it receives. If not specified it will just create a list, however if receives a True boolean it will create a different class for the list placing it on the right side of the page. This was used for the header, because I needed to get some information strictly on the right side. NavBarComponent is a basic flexcontain wrapper, not much to see here.








This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
